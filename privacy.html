                <h3>1. Introduction</h3>
                <p>Faith & Fit ("we," "our," or "us") respects your privacy and is committed to protecting your personal
                    data. This privacy policy will inform you as to how we look after your personal data when you visit
                    our website or use our mobile application ("App") and tell you about your privacy rights and how the
                    law protects you.</p>

                <h3>2. Information We Collect</h3>
                <h4>A. Device Data</h4>
                <p>We may collect information about your mobile device, including its model, operating system, and
                    unique device identifiers, solely for the purpose of analytics and crash reporting using standard
                    Apple services.</p>

                <h4>B. Health Data (Apple HealthKit)</h4>
                <p>Faith & Fit integrates with Apple's HealthKit to provide its core functionality. With your explicit
                    permission, we read data such as steps, active energy burned, and workouts. We write data such as
                    completed workouts. <strong>This data is processed locally on your device. We do not transfer your
                        HealthKit data to any external server for marketing, advertising, or data mining
                        purposes.</strong></p>

                <h4>C. Usage Data</h4>
                <p>We collect anonymous usage statistics (e.g., screens viewed, buttons tapped) to help us improve the
                    user experience. This data is aggregated and does not identify you personally.</p>

                <h3>3. How We Use Your Data</h3>
                <p>We use your data to:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Provide customized workout plans based on your fitness level.</li>
                    <li>Track your progress towards your goals.</li>
                    <li>Integrate biblical themes relevant to your journey.</li>
                    <li>Maintain and improve the safety and security of the App.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>4. Data Storage and Security</h3>
                <p>Faith & Fit is built with a "Local First" architecture. Your personal profile, journal entries, and
                    workout history are stored:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Locally on your device (SwiftData).</li>
                    <li>In your personal iCloud container (if iCloud Drive is enabled), where it is secured by Apple's
                        encryption standards.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>We do not maintain a central database of user profiles.</p>

                <h3>5. Third-Party Services</h3>
                <p>We use RevenueCat to manage subscriptions. RevenueCat collects anonymous App User IDs to process
                    purchases. We only see that a user with a specific anonymous ID has an active subscription.</p>

                <h3>6. Your Legal Rights</h3>
                <p>Under certain circumstances, you have rights under data protection laws in relation to your personal
                    data, including the right to request access, correction, erasure, restriction, transfer, or to
                    object to processing options.</p>
                <p>Since we do not store your data on our servers, you can exercise your "Right to Erasure" simply by
                    deleting the App and its data from your device.</p>

                <h3>7. Contact Details</h3>
